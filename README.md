# Scenario:

1.  Search - open www.flipkart.com (it would show a popup, you need to cancel the popup), perform a search for term 'shoes', you now need to verify that the values on the search page are actually searched for shoes. 

2. Apply Filters - You can choose two filters - eg - price & brand. You need to ensure the filters are selected. Again this is left a bit open-ended for you to come up with the asserts yourself. 

3. Product Detail Page - Open the detail page of the first result, select the size of the item & then click 'buy now'. You should be on login page now
